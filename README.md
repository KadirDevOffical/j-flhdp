# Introduction

## Install
```npm
npm install nsml
```

#### What Ä°s NSML?

NSML writes information about running your Node project.

### Why NSML?

If you are working with a large team, you may need to see most of the information about your project, such as what time of day, which file, and whether it should receive errors.

Or maybe you just wanted to install it.
